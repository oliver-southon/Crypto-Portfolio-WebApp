# Crypto-Portfolio-WebApp - ACCESS LATEST VERSION UNDER "v3_Django"

URL: (still to be deployed)

This is an interactive cryptocurrency portoflio tracker that utilises Python Django for backend web development, Bootstrap for the front-end, and the CoinGecko + FearAndGreed API for live data retrieval. It uses Django's default authentication system to save each portfolio for each user. While it obviously cannot actually trade cryptocurrency, it may prove useful for people who trade crypto and wish to see live statistics on their positions (profit, loss, percentage gain, etc). Binance does not provide these features.

## FOR DEVELOPERS
 >1. Clone the github repository
 >2. To use the latest version 'cd' into the _v3_Django_ folder.

 >4. Run _py manage.py runserver_
 >5. Done!

Please note: There may be some dependencies not mentioned in the requirements.txt file. If so, the terminal will say which oens you are missing.

## FOR USERS
>1. Access it at the URL mentioned above
>2. Register an account - you won't need an email or phone, just a username.
>3. Done! I hope you find this useful if you do any crypto trading.
