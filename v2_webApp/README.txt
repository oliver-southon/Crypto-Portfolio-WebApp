TO RUN THIS APPLICATION

(Requires Python >3.6)

1) Ensure all modules in 'requiremnts.txt' have been installed in your own virtual environment.
2) Replace the environment variables (found in 'main.py' and './CoinTools.py') with your own Binance and SQL details.
3) run main.py and go to the address outputted in terminal.

** NOTE: Redesign is in progress. I am aiming to:
- Imporve optimisation and clean the code
- Add ability to set position in market price automatically (in real time)
- Eventually deploy and add ability to create accounts (Will need a django adaption though)
